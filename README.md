### About
This repository contains more detailed use cases and analyses associated with the `diffloop` workflow.
Figure 1E was created using the R/Shiny interface [DNAlandscapeR](https://dnalandscaper.aryeelab.org). 

### Important information
- Install [git large file storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) before cloning repository to access full data (~ 2 GB total).
- Link to ChIA-PET Pre-processing software: [mango](https://github.com/dphansti/mango)
- A recent version of [diffloop](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/diffloop.html)
is required to run the code in this repository.
We'd recommend installing from Bioconductor to ensure a recent, stable version--
```
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("diffloop")
```
