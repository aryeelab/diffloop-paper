# diffloop paper repository

## About

This repository contains the code needed to generate all figures and tables in the manuscript shown above. Figure 1 was created using the R/Shiny interface [DNAlandscapeR](https://dnalandscaper.aryeelab.org). 
Note: the numbering of the tables and figures has changed between versions; the code will generate all the appropriate figures, but they may be differentially labeled relative to the version of the manuscript. 

## Important information

* Install [git large file storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) before cloning repository to access full data
* Link to ChIA-PET Pre-processing software: [mango](https://github.com/dphansti/mango)
* A recent version of [diffloop](https://github.com/aryeelab/diffloop) is required to run the code in this repository. We'd recommend installing from our lab github branch for the most recent version and features `devtools::install_github("aryeelab/diffloop")`
* One should just be able to run the scripts in "Code" to reproduce the analyses in the text and get a snense of how diffloop works.
* A reasonable recent vignette showcasing additional functionality and analysis is present [here](https://rpubs.com/caleblareau/diffloop_vignette).
